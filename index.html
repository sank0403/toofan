		  TOOFAN is a Test against time of your knowledge on the Indian Premiere League. The objective is to identify the mystery player, before the clock runs out.
		  <br><br>
		  You need to identify a player who has either been a Winning Captain, has won the Orange/Purple Cap, been the Man of the Match in the Finals, hit the Max no: of 6s, been the Player of the Series or been the Emerging Player of the series in a particular edition. 
		  <br><br>
		  You get a total of 60 seconds to identify the player. At set intervals, you get a clue about the mystery player. You lose if the clock winds down!
		  <br><br>
		  Use the on-screen keyboard to key in your answer. You can have multiple goes and Hit Enter to submit. The clock is stopped when you identify the player successfully.  	
		  <br><br>
		  Pay attention to the number of characters in the players first and last names. This is another clue, that could be of help. 
		  <br><br>
